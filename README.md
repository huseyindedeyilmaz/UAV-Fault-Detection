# ALFA UAV Dataset Model Training

This project focuses on developing various deep learning models for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) data analysis using the **ALFA UAV Dataset**. The models implemented include CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, xLSTM, and LSTM Autoencoder architectures. The project is developed using **PyTorch** and run within **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Project Overview
In this project, several neural network architectures have been applied to analyze the ALFA UAV dataset, a dataset focused on unmanned aerial vehicle operations and performance. The models are trained to classify or predict UAV activities based on temporal and spatial data. Specifically, the following models are trained and evaluated:
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
- Extended LSTM (xLSTM)
- LSTM Autoencoder

The project aims to explore and compare the performance of these different models on the UAV dataset, focusing on metrics like accuracy, loss, and training time.

## Dataset
The **ALFA UAV Dataset** is utilized for training the models. It contains data related to UAV operations, including sensor readings, flight information, and control commands. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets for model evaluation.

- **Input Data**: Temporal sequences of UAV sensor and control data.
- **Target**: Labels corresponding to specific UAV activities or conditions.

The dataset was preprocessed for compatibility with PyTorch models, and data normalization and windowing techniques were applied to enhance model performance.

## Models Implemented
1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**:
   - Designed to capture spatial relationships in the UAV data.
   
2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
   - A standard LSTM network used for capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.
   
3. **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)**:
   - A variation of LSTM that captures dependencies from both past and future sequences.
   
4. **xLSTM (Extended LSTM)**:
   - An enhanced version of LSTM with additional layers or features for improved performance.
   
5. **LSTM Autoencoder**:
   - An autoencoder architecture that uses LSTM for both encoding and decoding, suitable for anomaly detection or data reconstruction tasks.

Each model is trained with the same set of hyperparameters for a fair comparison.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. You can do this by following the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ALFA-UAV-Model-Training.git
   cd ALFA-UAV-Model-Training
   ```

2. Set up a Python environment and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. If necessary, modify the `environment.yaml` file to suit your environment.

4. Install PyTorch if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```

## Usage
To train the models and evaluate their performance, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the notebook file that contains the training script, e.g., `train_models.ipynb`.

3. Run the cells to start training the models. You can adjust the parameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and learning rate within the notebook.

4. After training, the evaluation metrics will be printed, and you can visualize loss and accuracy over time.

### Example Commands
- To train the CNN model:
  ```python
  model = CNN()
  train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader)
  ```

- To train the LSTM model:
  ```python
  model = LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)
  train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader)
  ```

You can similarly train the BiLSTM, xLSTM, and LSTM Autoencoder by initializing the corresponding model classes.

## Results
Each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of the models varied, with **xLSTM** showing the best overall results in terms of accuracy and convergence time. Below is a summary of the results:

| Model            | Training Accuracy | Validation Accuracy | Loss      |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| CNN              | 94.5%             | 94.1%               | 0.98      |
| LSTM             | 97%               | 97%                 | 0.95      |
| BiLSTM           | 96.1%             | 96.1%               | 0.93      |
| xLSTM            | 96.8%             | 97.1%               | 0.92      |
| mLSTM            | 96.2%             | 95.9%               | 0.94      |
| sLSTM            | 97.5%             | 97.4%               | 0.92      |
| LSTM Autoencoder | N/A (Anomaly Detection Task) | N/A | N/A        |
